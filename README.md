# Field-data-for-macroscopic-traffic-flow-model
Field data collected from a segment of Interstate Freeway I-15 in Utah. The dataset includes measurements of mileage (mile) and elapsed time (min) as input variables ($\mathbf{X}$) and flow (veh/5min) and average speed (mph) as output variables ($\mathbf{Y}$). The data was collected between August 5, 2019, and August 19, 2019, from 20 detectors, with a total of 288 observations recorded per detector each day. The dataset file I15.npz has already been divided into training data, validation data, and testing data.
